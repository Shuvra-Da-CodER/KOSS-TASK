# KOSS-TASK
## Random world generation algorithms.

### Overview
This project explores random world generation techniques using procedural algorithms. The primary focus is on generating realistic terrain, landscapes, and cave systems using various mathematical methods.

### Algorithms Covered
1.Perlin Noise - Used for generating smooth, natural-looking terrain.

2.Simplex Noise - An alternative to Perlin noise with improved performance and fewer artifacts.

3.Voronoi Diagrams - Useful for biome generation and clustering terrain features.

4.Cellular Automata - Used primarily for cave and dungeon generation.

### There is a sample code for cave generation in maps using cellular automata
